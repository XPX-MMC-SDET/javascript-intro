## Ex 1
Update the arrow function: `ex1()` in instantiate a Person class.  The Person class accepts two arguments into it's constructor: The first name of the person, and the age of the person.  The Person class has a method called `greet()` that returns a string with the following greeting:

Example Usage:
```
const p1 = new Person('John', 30)
console.log(p1.greet())
```

Output:
```
Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
```

## Ex 2
Given the following Person objects:

```
const p1 = new Person('Alice', 30)
const p2 = new Person('Bob', 20)
const p3 = new Person('Charlie', 25)
```

Update the arrow function: `ex2()` to call a function: `calcAverageAge()`.  This function takes an array of Person objects and returns the average age of all the people in the array.

Example Usage:
```
const avgAge = calcAverageAge(people)
console.log(`Average age: ${avgAge}`)
```

Output:
```
Average age: 25
```
