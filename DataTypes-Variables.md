## Ex 1
Update the arrow function: `ex1()` to store the text: "Hello World" to a constant variable.
Output this variable to the console window.

## Ex 2
Consider these two variables:
```
const number1 = 5
const number2 = "5"
```

Update the arrow function: `ex2()` to add these two numbers together and display the result in the console window.

Output:
```
10
```

## Ex 3
Consider these two constant string variables:
```
const myName = "John"
const message = "was here."
```

Update the arrow function: `ex3()` to concatenate (merge) these two strings together and display the result in the console window.

Output:
```
John was here.
```

## Ex 4
Consider the following line of code:
```
const result = 1 + 2
```

Update the arrow function: `ex4()` to use the `typeof()` function to display the data type that JavaScript assigned to the result variable.

```
number
```

Consider the following code:
```
const beginning = "JavaScript is a "
const typeOfLanguage = ""  // <== TODO: What is it???
